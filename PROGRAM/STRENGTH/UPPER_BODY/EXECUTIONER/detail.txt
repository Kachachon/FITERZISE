Prodigious upper body strength and a powerful core are just what The Executioner is designed to deliver. This is a Level IV workout which gives you an idea of the load that builds up on the muscles as you flow from one exercise to the next and then go through one set after another. Add EC and this is probably a borderline Level V workout. You have been warned.
