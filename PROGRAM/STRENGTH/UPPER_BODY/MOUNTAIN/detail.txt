The Mountain is an upper-body bodyweight training strength workout. That means that punches are delivered in full extension, slowly with the elbow joint locking out so that the muscle groups at the tricep and shoulder can be activated. Focus on form here and make sure the muscles move through the entire range of motion. Add EC for that extra feeling of Special.
