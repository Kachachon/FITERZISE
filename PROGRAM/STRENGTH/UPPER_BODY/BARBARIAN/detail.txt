Unleash the barbarian within you with a total strength workout that loads muscles concentrically and eccentrically and works them throughout each set for best results. Make your punches slow and deliberate, swiveling on the foot on the side of the arm that's throwing the punch each time, so you can transfer your body weight behind it and make sure you lock the joint to activate shoulder muscles and triceps. Add EC. (You know you want to).
