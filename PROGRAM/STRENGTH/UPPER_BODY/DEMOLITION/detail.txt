Demolition is a level four strength workout that targets the upper body and core and helps you get pumped in no time at all. Do each exercise slowly (including the punches), pay attention to form and go through the full range of motion (which means the push ups are really deep) and you will feel the benefits from all this long before the workout itself is over.
