The Prowler takes you to the floor and keeps you there while it focuses on lower body muscles and tendons so that you can develop the kind of serious muscle power that will amplify your every movement afterwards. This is a Level III workout but don't let that fool you, getting through all seven sets requires focus and determination and if you add EC it doesn't give you a lot of time to recover.
