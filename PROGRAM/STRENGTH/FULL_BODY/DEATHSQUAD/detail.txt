Deathsquad is a full body, strength workout that begins to exert its influence on the body's muscles shortly after you get through the very first set. Although it's just level III in difficulty, it doesn't take long before fatigue kicks in and then you're working through that figurative wall the other side of which lies the physical strength you crave. Add EC and the challenge really begins to spike.
